Gravitation Simulator
=====================

Author: Lance Goodridge

Description: A 3D simulation of a group of particles in a vacuum, attracted to each other by gravity. You can dynamically add new particles of different masses, change the camera orientation and zoom, and (most importantly) make the particles explode!!!

Environment: The core code that handles the logic for the simulation was written in Processing. The display window and container (and thus, the app itself) was implemented as a JApplet and was written and tested from Eclipse.
